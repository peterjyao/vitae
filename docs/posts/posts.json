To make the rest of the site match the About Me page better (created with the postcards package), I added a bit to the site styles.css, which I expect I will play with more in the future.\n\n@import url(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Slab&display=swap\");\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  font-family: \"Roboto Slab\";\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Roboto Slab\";\n  background-color: #f5e9dd;\n}\n\n@import url(\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Slab&display=swap\");\n\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {\n  font-family: \"Roboto Slab\";\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Roboto Slab\";\n  background-color: #f5e9dd;\n}\n\nAt the moment there is a slight difference in how the navbar looks on the pages. Hopefully I can figure out how to fix that at some point.\nI wanted to try to use the same data source I used for my CV, which I partially made using the vitae package–I say partially, because I ended up fine tuning it directly in the LaTeX file. It’s a bit hacky but works. Below is for the “Experience” section.\n\n\nlibrary(\"glue\")\n\ndata_source_root <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterjyao/cv/main/data\"\n\nexperience <- read.csv(url(glue(\"{data_source_root}/experience.csv\")))\n\n# fix the date formatting\nexperience$dates <- gsub(\"\\'\", \"20\", experience$dates)\nexperience$dates <- gsub(\"-\", \" - \", experience$dates)\n\nexperience$description_formatted <- glue(\n    .envir = experience,\n    \"**{role}**&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;{dates}\",\n    \"*{org}*&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;{place}\",\n    \"{description}\",\n    .sep = \"<br>\"\n  )\n\ncat(paste(experience$description_formatted, collapse = \"<br><br>\"))\n\n\n\nI used similar code for the “Education” and “Languages” section, so I should probably make a function out of it.\n\n\n\n",
