"Lead Scientist","Nov '20-","Lonza AG","Basel, Switzerland","Drug Product Services: pharmaceutical development studies for liqid and lyophilized biologic drug products. Laboratory-scale modeling of fill/finish processes.",""
"Senior Associate Scientist","Jan '18-Oct '20","Janssen Pharmaceuticals","Schaffhausen, Switzerland","Large Molecule Process Development: aseptic fill/finish processes for new product introductions and technical transfers at Schaffhausen facility.","Implemented laboratory study workflow to evaluate filtration performance and ensure smooth operation of the critical unit operation in aseptic manufacturing. Worked with internal laboratory team and external vendors to achieve filter validation for multiple programs. Led development laboratory efforts to identify solutions to technical problems in manufacture of a commercial product and create estimated 1M CHF/year in savings when implemented. Collaborated with multifunctional team to identify and implement new process analytical technologies to verify process models and gain new insights during manufacturing."
"Senior Associate Scientist","Oct '15-Dec '17","Janssen Pharmaceuticals","Schaffhausen, Switzerland","Small Molecule API: support for late-stage chemical development of small molecule APIs and intermediates. Crystallisation process development and process analytical technologies.","Responsible for development, evaluation of polymorph control, and definition of proven acceptable ranges of key crystallisation step in synthetic route for a commercial product. Identified crystallisation conditions to deliver a streamlined process without an intermediate isolation step of a highly potent API. Investigated reaction mechanism of a critical alkylation reaction using process analytical technologies and automatic sampling to aid in process design and documentation for health authorities. Led the study of an enantiomeric resolution by crystallisation to establish fundamental system properties and identify key crystal forms."
"Research Scientist","Jan '08-Aug '13","Bristol-Myers Squibb","New Brunswick (NJ), USA","Chemical Development: support for early-stage chemical development of small molecule APIs and intermediates. Synthetic route evaluation. Enabling syntheses to deliver clinical material.","Responsible for development of a process to deliver API for a commercial product with highly specific powder properties suitable for roller compaction and acted as liaison between laboratory development team and pilot plant operations team. Worked with a rapidly organised team to deliver clinical material of a highly potent intermediate for an antibody drug conjugate under aggressive timelines. Collaborated on diverse multi-functional teams to achieve multiple end-to-end objectives across a variety of projects for six development programs."
